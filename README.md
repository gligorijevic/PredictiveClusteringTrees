PredictiveClusteringTrees
=========================

Raw implementation of PCT algorithm for clustering graph edges and graph nodes predictions.
Temporal aspect of graphs is modeled via feature functions defined on input variables(graph nodes attributes)

For more details on algorithm please refer to Blockeel H., Raedt L., Ramon J., "Top-down induction of clustering trees", in ICML, 1998.
